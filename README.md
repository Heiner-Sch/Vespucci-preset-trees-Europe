A Vespucci preset to add/edit trees and tree rows in Europe

There are the same species in, like in the JOSM preset: 
https://github.com/Heiner-Sch/JOSM-preset-trees-Europe

If you are botanic enough, take the Vespucci-Trees-botanic.xml as your preset in Vespucci.

If you prefer the common names of the trees, take the Vespucci-Trees-XX.zip file as your preset and enable the translation.

To add another language, copy preset.pot to preset_xx.po.
Translate the strings in preset_xx.po.
Put both into a .zip file and use it as your preset in Vespucci.

In the moment it's only in DE available.
In the next days EN and FR will follow.

If there are corrections needed, let me know.
