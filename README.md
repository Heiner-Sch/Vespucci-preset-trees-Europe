A Vespucci preset to add/edit trees and tree rows in Europe

There are the same species in, like in the JOSM preset: 
https://github.com/Heiner-Sch/JOSM-preset-trees-Europe

If you are botanic enough, take the Vespucci-Trees-botanic.xml as your preset in Vespucci.

If you prefer the common names of the trees, take the Vespucci-Trees-XX.zip file as your preset and enable the translation.

To add another language, copy preset.pot to preset_xx.po.
Translate the strings in preset_xx.po.
Put both into a .zip file and use it as your preset in Vespucci.

If there are corrections needed, let me know.
